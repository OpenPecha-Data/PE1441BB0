Direct Instruction

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Considering the extent of the teachings handed down from the gurus of the past, there is no
need to add anything new.Yet simply to avoid turning down your request, the direct instruction
is as follows:

I pay homage at the feet of the guru,And here present the essence of key pointsFrom the clear
light vajra pinnacle:[1]

Having laid a foundation with the path of devotion,And severed the basis of the deluded mind
at its source,Naturally and without contrivance,Sustain clear and empty awareness,Which is
inexpressible and without basis or origin.When you know the key point of how toNaturally
release dualistic thoughts, they will no longer bind you.

For enhancement, focus on the mergingOf the outer and inner skies.Settle without clinging in
all-pervasiveness.

Cultivate renunciation, compassion and bodhicitta,And strive to adopt and avoid actions according
to their effects—this is crucial.

The one called Chökyi Lodrö
Offered these few words of instruction.
