Emptying the Three Realms of Existence

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ahoye!The natural state of primordial purity is unimaginable and inexpressible,Utterly beyond
the extremes of existence and non-existence.It is not a blank vacuity but by nature lucid,Bright
with the natural radiance of clear light.Through the practice of the four lamps,The
intensely radiant visions of spontaneous perfection,May ordinary conditioned appearances
dissolve into inner space,And in a state of unobscured primordial wisdomLet us seize the
stronghold of immovable realizationAnd empty the three realms of existence from their very
depths!
