The Final Testament of Yukhok Chatralwa as Transmitted to Lama Rigdzin Nyima
by Yukhok Chatral Chöying Rangdrol

rigpa gyurmé chen po la namo
Homage to great, unchanging rigpa!
tawa rigpé gyalpo la
In the view, king-like pure awareness,
gompa chok lhung dralwa shyok
Let meditation settle, beyond position or bias,
chöpa nyidzin trulwa shyik
And, as action, let duality and delusion be destroyed.
drebu ku sum yé dzok la
The fruition is the already perfect three kāyas,
damtsik pang lang yul lé dé
Beyond samaya commitments involving acceptance and rejection.
rigpa cher tong gi gyalpo
Thus, the king of nakedly seen awareness
ta gom chö dré kyi damtsik gi gyé chépa
Is sealed with the samayas of view, meditation, action and fruition.

This final testament spoken by Yukhok Lama Chöying Rangdrol was recorded by the one called Sūrya.
