The Key Points of Trekchö

by Mipham Rinpoche

Dhīḥ! Before the wisdom-being Mañjuśri, I reverently bow down.Here I shall explain the key points
of Trekchö—Thorough Cut.

Do not alter the mind but allow it to settle as it is.And, in such a state, look naturally within.There
will unfold an experience that is indescribable,Which has no fixed character as
either this or that,And the natural radiance of which will not cease.This is the genuine
state, the natural condition,The actual dharmatā, beyond conception.It is the insight born
of natural luminosity,The view: like a mountain, left as it is.

As you simply abide by that natural state,There is neither meditation nor distraction.Without
suppressing, cultivating, evaluating or analysing,Allow yourself to settle fully into the
genuine state.This is the natural concentration of dharmatā,Uncorrupted by the bonds of
deliberate action.Abiding in the yoga that is the King of Space,This is meditation: like the
ocean, left as it is.

As you remain like this,Any thoughts and impressions that stir withinAnd any appearances that
occur without,Should neither be prevented nor encouraged but left as they are.As long as
you do not stray from this natural state,Whatever unfolds will bring neither benefit nor
harm.Without concern for good or bad, acceptance or rejection,This is action: appearances,
left as they are.

As you make progress, all that appears and existsWill become a single all-embracing sphere of
aware-emptiness,Within which everything is entirely perfect and complete.This happens effortlessly,
is spontaneously accomplished.Any striving to adopt or abandon simply fades away,And
hopes and fears for saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are no more.The primordial nature is made manifest
—The fruition: awareness, left as it is.

This instruction, including the four ways of leaving things as they are,Is the ultimate purport
of the Thorough Cut.With these key points, liberation will swiftly be attainedAs the most
glorious form of Mañjuśrī, Gentle Splendour.

This arose from the lake-like mind of Mipham Jampal Gyepa during the Water Snake year (1893–4).
