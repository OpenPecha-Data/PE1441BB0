The Nature of Mind

by Mipham Rinpoche

Mind’s nature is indivisible emptiness and clarity,Inexpressible and indestructible, like space.In
seeing it, there is no separate one who sees;There is but a single, all-encompassing
sphere.Even looker and looking are one and the same.This view of seeing all at once is unsurpassed,A
centreless, limitless, exceptional experience.In this fruition in which what
has to be done has been done,There's no seeing at all, and any wish to see,Any deep longing
to discover the view,Is naturally destroyed from its very depths.To arrive at such contentment
and evenness[1]Is to be touched by brave Mañjuśrī's beneficent light.

Mipham wrote this on the 12th day of the seventh month, in the year of the Fire Rat (1876).

Some editions of the Tibetan have khong snyom, but according to Zenkar Rinpoche this is an error
for khod snyom.  ↩
