Advice on Recognizing the Nature of Mind

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

What we call mind is that which thinks endlessly of everything under the sun. When investigating
its essence to determine the true nature, we examine each momentary thought that originates,
remains and departs. We inquire where the arising might be and look into the place
or source of origination. We investigate the place of remaining and nature of what remains,
and, for the departure, the nature of what ceases and its place of cessation. Each time
we ask what these are like in essence. And through this, we realize that they lack even so
much as an atom’s worth of true reality. Yet in spite of this unreality, there is still
something which knows, or is aware of, good and bad, and which is present unceasingly. By
allowing this to settle by itself, without altering it or fabricating it in any way through
inviting or following thoughts, we can naturally experience a state that is beyond all expression
and is the inseparability of clarity, awareness and emptiness. To sustain the continuity
of this is what we call looking into the essence of mind.

Still, it is very important to purify obscurations as a preliminary, to pray to the guru with
deep devotion, and to exert oneself in receiving empowerment. When we understand this essence
of mind well, we will not have so much attachment and aversion towards friends and enemies
or hope or fear concerning pleasure and pain. This is difficult to realize, no matter
who we might be.

Chökyi Lodrö offered this merely to avoid turning down a request.
