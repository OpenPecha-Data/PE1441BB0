Pith Instruction on the Three Crucial Statements

by Mipham Rinpoche

Namo mañjuśrīye!

Ordinary cognizance, free and open,Is incommunicable in words; you must know it for yourselfWhen
fabrication and fixation are naturally eliminated—That is what is called ‘knowing the
essence of mind’.

Without getting caught up in the tangle of thoughts,Not losing the experience of the genuine
nature,While not striving with deliberate effort—That is what is called ‘sustaining meditation’.


When remaining mentally composed,And all the waves of varied thought, like clouds in the sky,Bring
neither benefit nor harm—That is what is called ‘immediate freedom’.

This instruction on the three crucial statementsIs to be realized as an inner experience;Rambling
talk and ideas will not lead to understanding.

Written by Mipham Nampar GyalwaOn the 19th day of the second month of the Fire Monkey (1896).
