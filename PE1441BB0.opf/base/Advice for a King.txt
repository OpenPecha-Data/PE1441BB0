Advice for a King

by Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu

Svasti.You might have a hundred or a thousand teachers,But the one who introduces you to mind's
nature is supreme,Superior in kindness even to the Buddha —To the root guru, I bow down
in homage.

The very essence of your own mind,Is entirely beyond arising, ceasing and remaining —This is
what followers of the Great PerfectionCall rigpa, pure and open awareness.

The essence of this approach is none other thanTaking this awareness as the path,In undistracted,
non-meditation —So, without distraction, sustain the genuine nature.

What we call 'stillness and movement inseparable'Means that in stillness, which is beyond arising,There
is movement, which is beyond cessation —Stillness and movement, arising and ceasing,
are thus inseparable.

Undistracted awareness is the path of the Victorious,And distraction is the playground of saṃsāra.So
maintain awareness without distraction,Continuously, both day and night.

The nature of mind is clear light.Sullying thoughts are to be purified.But movement must neither
be rejected nor indulged.The stirrings of mind must naturally free themselves.

The source of virtuous actionIs none other than devotion for the guru.So exert yourself in guru
yoga,And avoid sporadic practice.

There is no limit to what could be said,But now is the time for essential practice,So may this
short explanationCause experience and realization to increase just like the waxing moon.

Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu wrote this for the practice of Amgön Tendzin, the king of Lowo in Ngari,
while in Mönthang on the 26th day of the eleventh month of the Earth Snake year (i.e.,
January 4, 1750).
